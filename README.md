# Analytical Curve Fitting Software
This project uses different libraries of python for a web application that takes data points and outputs a curve of best fit. This project uses Streamlit, Matplotlib, numpy and pandas for the GUI, plotting graphs, dealing with matrices etc. It fits curve using least squares meathod. 

# Options
The web application provides the option of chosing how to add the data. They can either upload a csv file or they can use the data table provided and add the data manually. They can also choice what type of curve they want to fit in. They can chose between polynomial, exponential and polynomial curve. For polynomial they have an option of what degree they want to fit in. If you want a histogream instead, you can chose the histogram option and now youcan enter x values but not y values and the web application will make a histogram accordingly.
